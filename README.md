# Earthquake Visualization Project

## Overview

This project visualizes earthquake data from around the world using Leaflet, D3.js, and the USGS Earthquake GeoJSON Feed. It dynamically displays earthquakes that occurred in the last seven days, illustrating their magnitude and depth on an interactive map. Users can view detailed information about each earthquake by clicking on the markers.

## Features

- **Interactive Map:** Utilizes Leaflet to render a dynamic map.
- **Earthquake Data:** Fetches real-time earthquake data from the USGS Earthquake GeoJSON Feed.
- **Magnitude and Depth Visualization:** Earthquakes are represented as circle markers. The size of each marker indicates the magnitude, while the color signifies the depth of the earthquake.
- **Popups:** Clicking on a marker displays a popup with more detailed information about the earthquake.
- **Legend:** Includes a legend to help interpret the marker sizes and colors.
